# js-timer

A small vanilla JS file containing two functions using setInterval.

The first, countdown(X), takes one arguement and logs a countdown in the console, starting from X. When the counter reaches 0, "DONE" is logged to console.

The second randomGame() uses the setInterval method to generate a new random number every 1000 milliseconds. 
Everytime a new random number is generated, the count increases by one. Both are logged to the console every interval. 
When the random number is larger than .75, the counter and a message are logged to the console.
